30. Can we pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of the super class? Are static
members inherited to sub classes?

Ans. Yes, we can pass an object of a subclass to a method that expects an object of the superclass in Dart. 
This is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming known as polymorphism. When you pass a subclass object
to a method expecting a superclass object, the method can operate on the subclass object as if it were an instance of 
the superclass.

Regarding static members, they are not inherited by subclasses in Dart. Static members belong to the class itself rather
than to any instance of the class. Therefore, they are not inherited and cannot be overridden by subclasses. However, they can 
be accessed using the class name.
