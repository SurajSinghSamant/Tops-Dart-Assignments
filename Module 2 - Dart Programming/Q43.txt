43. Can a subclass static method hide superclass instance method?

Ans. A subclass static method cannot hide a superclass instance method. Static methods belong to the class itself
rather than to instances of the class, while instance methods are tied to the instances. Therefore, they operate in 
different scopes and do not interfere with each other. However, if a subclass defines a static method with the same 
name as an instance method in the superclass, it will not hide or override the instance method. Instead, both methods
will coexist, and their usage will depend on the context (whether the method is called on the class itself or an instance
of the class).
