42. Can a subclass instance method override a superclass static method?

Ans. No, a subclass instance method cannot override a superclass static method. In object-oriented programming,
static methods belong to the class itself rather than any instance of the class. Therefore, they cannot be overridden
by instance methods in a subclass. Instead, if a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static
method in the superclass, it hides the superclassâ€™s static method rather than overriding it.
