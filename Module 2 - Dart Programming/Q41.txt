41. What happens when a class implements two interfaces and both declare field (variable) with same name?

Ans. When a class in Dart implements two interfaces that both declare a field (variable) with the same name, it can lead to ambiguity.
Dart does not allow a class to have two fields with the same name, even if they come from different interfaces. This will result in
a compile-time error.

To resolve this, we can use getter and setter methods instead of fields in the interfaces. This way, the implementing class can
provide its own implementation for these methods, avoiding the conflict.
