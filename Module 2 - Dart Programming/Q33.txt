33. How do you implement multiple inheritance in Dart?

Ans. Dart doesn’t support multiple inheritance directly, meaning a class cannot inherit from more
than one class. However, we can achieve similar functionality using mixins. Mixins allow us to reuse
a class’s code in multiple class hierarchies, providing a way to add functionality to classes without
using inheritance.
