44. Can a superclass access subclass member?

Ans. A superclass cannot directly access the members (fields, methods, etc.) of its subclass. The relationship
in inheritance is such that the subclass inherits from the superclass, not the other way around. This means that
while a subclass can access and override the members of its superclass, the superclass does not have knowledge of
the members defined in its subclasses.
