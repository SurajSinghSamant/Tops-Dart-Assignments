22. Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why? B3. What is advantage of inheritance?

Ans. Dart does not support multiple inheritance. This means a class cannot inherit from more than one superclass directly.

The reason for not supporting multiple inheritance is, 
Complexity and Ambiguity : Multiple inheritance can cause introduce complexity and ambiguity in the class hierarchy. 
For example, if two superclasses have methods with the same name, it can be unclear which method the subclass should inherit.

Advantage of inheritance : 
i. Code Reusability : Inheritance allows for the reuse of existing code. By inheriting from a superclass, you can use and 
extend the methods and properties defined in that class, reducing the need for code duplication.

Ease of Maintenance : Changes to the base class are automatically reflected in subclasses. This centralized modification can
simplify maintenance and updates.

Logical Hierarchy : It helps create a natural hierarchy in code. The relationships between classes are represented in a clear,
structured way, which enhances readability and organization.

Enhanced Functionality : Subclasses can extend or override the functionality of the superclass, allowing for more specialized 
behavior while still maintaining a consistent interface.

Polymorphism : Inheritance supports polymorphism, which means that a single interface can be used to represent different underlying
forms (data types). This allows for writing more flexible and reusable code.
