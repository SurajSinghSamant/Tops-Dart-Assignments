40. Difference between method overriding and overloading in Dart.

Ans. * Method Overriding :  Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method
that is already defined in its superclass.

Purpose : It allows a subclass to provide a specific behavior for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

Usage : Used to implement polymorphism, allowing a subclass to define behavior specific to its type.

* Method Overloading : Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different
parameters (different type or number of parameters).

Purpose : It allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different functionalities based on the parameters.

Usage : Used to increase the readability of the program by allowing the same method name to perform different tasks based on parameters.
