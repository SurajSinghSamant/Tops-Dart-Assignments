25. Can we override static method in Dart?

Ans. No, you cannot override static methods in Dart. Static methods belong to the class itself rather than
any instance of the class, and they are not inherited by subclasses. This means that each class has its own
version of the static method, and there is no mechanism to override it in a subclass.
