27. Can a class implement more than one interface? Can a class extend more than one class in Dart?

Ans. Yes, a class can implement more than one interface. This is a common feature in many programming languages,
including Dart. Implementing multiple interfaces allows a class to inherit the abstract methods from multiple
sources, providing a way to achieve kind of multiple inheritance.
