31. What happens if the parent and the child class have a field with same identifier? Are constructors and initializers
also inherited to sub classes ?

Ans. If both the parent and child classes have a field with the same identifier, the field in the child class will hide
the field in the parent class. This means that when you access the field from an instance of the child class, you will
get the value of the field defined in the child class, not the parent class.
