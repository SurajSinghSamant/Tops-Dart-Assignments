36. When to overload a method in Dart and when to override it?

Ans. Method overloading occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters(different number
or types of parameters) within the same class. We use method overloading when we want to provide multiple ways to 
perform a similar operation with different inputs.

Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
We use method overriding when you want to change or extend the behavior of a method inherited from a superclass. This allows you to
provide specific implementations in subclasses while keeping a common interface. Also, it supports polymorphism, enabling us to treat
objects of different subclasses uniformly while still executing subclass-specific behavior.
