39. What are the rules of method overriding in Dart?

Ans. Method overriding in Dart allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is
already defined in its superclass. Here are the key rules for method overriding in Dart :

i. Method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass.

ii. Use of @override Annotation, itâ€™s a good practice to use the @override annotation to indicate that a method is 
intended to override a method in the superclass.

iii. The overriding method must have the same or more accessible visibility than the method in the superclass. For example,
if the superclass method is public, the overriding method cannot be private.

iv. Cannot override final or static Methods : Methods declared as final or static in the superclass cannot be overridden in the subclass.

v. Constructors cannot be overridden. However, we can call a superclass constructor from a subclass constructor using the super keyword.
