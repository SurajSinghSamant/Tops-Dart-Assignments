24. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism.

Ans. * Inheritance :

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOPS(object-oriented programminig) that allows one class to inherit the
properties and methods from another class. The class which inherites the properties and methods from other class is
called child class, and the class which provides the properties and methods is called the parent class.

* Polymorphism :

Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated
as objects of a common superclass. The term comes from Greek words meaning "many forms." Polymorphism enables a single 
interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).
