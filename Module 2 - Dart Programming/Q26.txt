26. Can we overload static method in Dart?

Ans. In Dart, we cannot overload static methods. Method overloading, which allows multiple methods with the
same name but different parameters, is not supported for static methods in Dart. Static methods are bound to
the class itself rather than an instance of the class, and Dart does not allow multiple static methods with the
same name.
