23. Difference between inheritance and encapsulation. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.

Ans. * Inheritance :

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOPS(object-oriented programminig) that allows one class to inherit the
properties and methods from another class. The class which inherites the properties and methods from other class is
called child class, and the class which provides the properties and methods is called the parent class.

* Encapsulation : 

Encapsulation is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that bundles data and methods into units that are easy
to use. It can be used to restrict direct access to some components of an object, such as hiding data members and methods.
This can help to increase control over data, protect information from being modified, and prevent errors.

* Abstraction :

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
It allows a programmer to work with a simplified interface while hiding the complex underlying code.
